Tobasu is a minimal, elegant content-sharing tool. It allows you to **"throw" (jp: Tobasu)** URLs from one device to another instantly, as long as they are on the same Wi-Fi network.  

- **Receiver**: [https://ryokokuga.github.io/Tobasu/](https://ryokokuga.github.io/Tobasu/)
- **Sender**: [https://ryokokuga.github.io/Tobasu/send.html](https://ryokokuga.github.io/Tobasu/send.html) 



## ✨ Features

- **Seamless Transfer**: Instantly send URLs to other devices without manual configuration.
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Powered by PeerJS for direct device-to-device communication.
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects the receiver on your network. No IP typing required.
- **Network Bound**: Designed to work exclusively between devices sharing the same public IP.

## 🛠️ Components

The project consists of two simple interfaces:
- **Receiver**: A standby interface that prompts an approval dialog upon receiving content.
- **Sender**: A streamlined transmitter that auto-detects the active receiver on the same network.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Host the Files
Deploy the HTML files to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Vercel, etc.) or run them on a local server.

### 2. Launch Receiver
Open the **Receiver** on the target device (e.g., PC, Tablet, or TV).
- Status will show "● Ready on the same Wi-Fi".

### 3. Launch Sender
Open the **Sender** on your source device (e.g., Smartphone).
- Enter the URL you wish to share.
- Tap **"Send Content"**.

### 4. Approve and Open
An alert will appear on the Receiver. Click **"Open"** to navigate to the shared link.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables, Flexbox, Keyframes)
- **Networking**: [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)
- **Utility**: [ipify API](https://www.ipify.org/)

## 📝 Usage Note
> **Note**: Both devices must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network (sharing the same public IP address) for the automatic discovery to function correctly.
